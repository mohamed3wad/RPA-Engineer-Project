# ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project contains instructions and implementation of a robot built using UiPath to automate a process involving email handling, web scraping, VPN activation, and API calls. The robot listens for a specific email, processes the attached data, fetches user information from a website, and sends this information via an API.
